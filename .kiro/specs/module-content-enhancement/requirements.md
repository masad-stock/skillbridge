# Module Content Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

The learner-pwa application currently has 9 learning modules across 5 categories (basic_digital, business_automation, e_commerce, digital_marketing, financial_management). While the modules have basic structure and some content, they need significant enhancement to provide comprehensive, engaging, and effective learning experiences. This feature will systematically improve module content quality, add missing elements, and ensure consistency across all modules.
